# Sheekha Portfolio (HTML + Node)

## Run locally
```bash
cd portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

The **Contact** form POSTs to **/contact**, and the server **echoes** the payload and
**logs** it to `contact.log` (ready to extend with Nodemailer/SES later).

Frontend:
- Bootstrap 5 + jQuery
- Typewriter (Typed.js), avatar tilt (VanillaTilt), ScrollReveal
- Mouse parallax, drifting SVG decor, background hue shift
- Theme toggle (Holographic Light / Dark Robotics) with `localStorage`

All sections are wired and responsive. Update text/images as needed.
